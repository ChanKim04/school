Example 1
	The main loop begins near line 695  makes a loop so that it will excute until 	the end of file is reached
	The loop on lines 740-770 makes a switch call so that it sets up the rule for 	each case.
	ex) case1: start command received then break / case2: stop command recived 			then break / case3: echo then break / case EOF: terminate

__________________________
	When a test input includes an underscore, the characters after the underscore 	apply grammar separately to the before part. For instance, R2D2 was identified 	as one word, but R2_D2 was identified as two separate WORD and _WORD. 2R_2D 	also was seen same as R2_D2 that the characters after the underscore was 	considered separately from the front part. When the test case only inputs an 	underscore, it echoes itself.

Example 4
	Symbols whose meaning is defined are called terminals
	Symbols whose meaning must be efined are called non-terminals
	Each non-terminal must be defined by a production rule.
	ex) 0-9 | heat | on|off | set | temperature are terminal
	ex) commands | command | heat_switch | temperature_set are non-terminal
	
Test
__________________________
[chan@chan 02]$ ./example4 
heat on       
       Heat turned on or off 
heat off 
       Heat turned on or off 
set temperature 5 
       Temperature set

Test end
__________________________

	It produces error correctly, but it does not return what I expect to have 	when I set the temperature. Also it doesn’t tell me whether the heat is 	turned on or off
	This is, however, very natural and anticipated, because bison haven’t recived 	any yylval. Instead all the inputs were remained in yytext.
