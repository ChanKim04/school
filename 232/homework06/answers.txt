1. Does your program run the same way each time? Why?
    The results do not seem to work the same way, 
    but you can see that there is some regularity when you look at the steps one by one. 
    This is because there is a certain degree of pattern in how semaphores are used. 
    Therefore, although it does not run the same way, it has particular pattern in detail.

2. Give your last customer thread the highest priority.
    Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority?
    Why or why not? (Note: remove any code that set the priority of threads before you submit your final code.)

    It does not ensure that the customer is always given first priority.
    This is because even though a particular customer may have a priority, 
    the customer may have to wait, depending on how the semaphores are set. 
    Therefore, we can not guarantee that customers with priorities always come first.
