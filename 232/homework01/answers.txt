    1. How many bytes of RAM does the virtual machine have by default?
		1024

    2. What are the registers that the virtual machine has?
		Program counter(pc) and three instruction registers(reg0, reg1, reg2)

    3. What arguments does the instruction JLZ take and what does the instruction 	do?
		Change pc to <dst> if register <reg> is smaller than 0

    4. When does the CPU check if an interrupt has occurred?
		Run the corresponding handler(s)

    5. What does the Monitor instruction S do?
		S <start> <end>: show memory from start to end
		Output the value at the memory locations from <start> to <end>

    6. What does the Monitor instruction ! Do?
		! : Toggle debugging on or off -- off at startup.
		On and off to show CPU state and debugging accoridng to bool

    7. Can assembly language files contain comments? How about blank lines?
		The assembly language files have commant lines and empty lines. However, 		those lines are not loaded into memory but skipped.		

    8. What function is called to write bytes into memory?
		 _poke_ram(self, starting_addr) is called to write bytes into memory. 			When an user type d <addr>, put data values into RAM starting at addr. 		If the input is valid, ‘self._ram[curr_addr] = data’ writes data into 			the memory location.

    9. Do assembly language programs assume they are loaded into memory at certain 	locations?
		Yes, fib.asm assumes that the code is loaded at location 100, and 			mult.asm assumes that the code is loaded at location 20.
